Introduction of ArrayList class


This is linear ds and built in.
Array is fixed size but array_list is dynamic size
1 - dynamic size means it can go bigger or smaller according to our needs , array is fixed bcoz we give particular size then that array can not be change its size.

2 - Primitive datatypes (int , char , float , boolean , etc) can't be stored directrly. but we can store by making objects of data types classes (Integer , floater etc..)

3 - We need to use "import java.util.ArrayList;" for accessing ArrayList class.

//sample code
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class ks{
    psvm{
        ArrayList<Integer> listone = new ArrayList<>();
        // here explation of line 14 are below
        //ArrayList - class name
        // ks - object name
        // new - keyboard which use to created space of arraylist object in heap memory.
        // ArrayList<>() - ArrayList<> (class name) , () - we call constructor of arraylist

        // <> - anugular brackets shows which type of data we want to store like below.

        ArrayList<String> list2 = new ArrayList<>();
        ArrayList<Boolean> list3 = new ArrayList<>();
    }
}
//Arraylist is part of collection frame work
